🛠️ How It Works
The form has two panels: one for login and one for registration.

JavaScript listens to button clicks and toggles a CSS class that triggers the slide animation.

CSS transform and transition properties create the smooth sliding effect.

Media queries ensure the layout adjusts for smaller screens.
